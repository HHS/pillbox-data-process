## About Pillbox 

Pillbox is a resource of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Pillbox is a United States government resource. 

### Overview
Pillbox is a database of human prescription, over-the-counter, homeopathic, and veterinary oral solid dosage medications (pills) marketed in the United States of America. This data set contains information about pills such as how they look, their ingredients, and other criteria. This data can be used to identify unknown pills based on their physical appearance. It also answers questions like “What pills contain acetaminophen?” or “What pills contain lactose as an inactive ingredient?” The data contain unique identifiers, such as the RXCUI and FDA product code.

### Notice: Non-verified Data

Pillbox’s data is created by combining drug information resources from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Library of Medicine (NLM) at the National Institutes of Health. This information has been reformatted to make it easier to work with but has not been verified by FDA or NLM. The information available for download may not be the labeling on currently distributed products or identical to the labeling that is approved. NLM makes no warranty that the data is error free.

#### Disclaimer

The pill images and accompanying data available here were obtained from products acquired from a licensed pharmacy or the product manufacturer. Manufacturers may alter the appearance (e.g., shape, color, size, markings) of medications over time.

The same medication may have been issued with a different appearance and/or different accompanying data before or after the date NLM acquired it. NLM would like to hear about any changes in medication appearance or possible errors in accompanying information. Please contact Pillbox by posting an issue in the Issue queue or sending an email to pillbox@mail.nih.gov if you notice any discrepancies in the information provided here.
