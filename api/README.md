## Pillbox Data

The Pillbox data is offered in three ways: 

1. Raw CSV access
  - We offer CSV access as the lowest common denominator for openness and use. At NLM, we have import into a MySQL database to run queries and checks, but the raw data is made available for open access. 

2. Static Json API 
  - We are offering the initial version of static API access for developers. We encourage using the index json files to return individual product json filenames. We are reviewing the use of these endpoints and how it can be improved. 

3. Dynamic Search API
  - A dynamic search API will still be made available for detailed searching. We are evaluating the use of this API and how it can be improved and paired with a static API.
