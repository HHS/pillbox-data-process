## Pillbox Data

The Pillbox data is made available in three methods:

1. Raw CSV access
  - We offer CSV access as the lowest common denominator for openness and use. At NLM, we use an additional import process into a MySQL database to run queries and checks, but the raw data is made available for open access.
  - Refer to [`datapackage.json`]() for information about the data files and date updated.   

2. Static Json API
  - We are offering the initial version of static API access for developers and data users. We encourage using the index json files to return individual product json filenames (coming soon). We are reviewing the use of these endpoints and how it can be improved.

3. Dynamic Search API
  - A dynamic search API is still available for detailed searching. See the [search API repository]() for access information.
